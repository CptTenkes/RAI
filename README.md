# RAI
RAI: an R package to calculate relative abundance index from camera-traps

This package calculate the relative abundance indices (encounter rates) of animal species obtained with camera-traps. 
The package calculate the RAI through three models: 
1) traditional or classical model grouping total data by species; 
2) alternative model that allows estimating the variation considering the data from each camera; and 
3) as a generalized linear Poisson model with trapping days as offset. 
The package have several aditional functions to generate and store tables, graphs, maps and statistical analyzes.
