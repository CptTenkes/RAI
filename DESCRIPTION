Title: Estimation of Relative Abundance Index from camera-traps
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Mandujano, S.

Description: This package calculate the relative abundance indices 
      (encounter rates) of animal species obtained with camera-traps. 
      The package calculate the RAI through three models: 
      1) traditional or classical model grouping total data by species; 
      2) alternative model that allows estimating the variation considering 
      the data from each camera; and 3) as a generalized linear Poisson model 
      with trapping days as offset. The package have several aditional functions to generate and store tables, graphs, maps and statistical analyzes.
